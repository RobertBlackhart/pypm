Python post-mortem debugging
============================

Pypm writes the traceback of an exception into a file and 
can later load it in a Python debugger. It works with the built-in 
pdb and with other popular debuggers (pudb, ipdb and pdbpp).

Pypm its based on [pydump](https://github.com/elifiner/pydump), 
developed by Eli Finer.

Why I wrote this?
=================

I spent way too much time trying to discern details about bugs from
logs that don't have enough information in them. Wouldn't it be nice
to be able to open a debugger and load the entire stack of the crashed
process into it and look around like you would if it crashed on your own 
machine?

Possible uses
=============

This project (or approach) might be useful in multiprocessing environments
running many unattended processes. The most common case for me is on
production web servers that I can't really stop and debug. For each 
exception caught, I write a dump file and I can debug each issue on 
my own time, on my own box, even if I don't have the source, since 
the relevant source is stored in the dump file.
